# Reinforcement Learning Game Environment

## Overview
This project implements a simple reinforcement learning environment using Python, OpenAI Gym, and Pygame. The agent moves in a 2D grid to collect coins and learns to maximize rewards through interaction with the environment.

## Features
- Custom reward function (+1 for collecting coin, -0.01 per step)
- Agent–environment interaction compatible with RL algorithms
- Pygame visualization for real-time feedback
- Modular, object-oriented design for easy extension

## Technologies
- Python 3
- OpenAI Gym
- Pygame
- NumPy

## Key Outcomes
- Implemented custom reward functions
- Designed an environment compatible with RL algorithms
- Gained practical experience with agent–environment interaction
- Prepared for reinforcement learning experimentation

## How to Run
```bash
cd src
python coin_collector_env.py
